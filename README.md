# Flask Ajax Like Button Demo

A simple, modern web application built with Python and Flask that demonstrates a multi-post feed with a real-time "like" button. The like functionality is powered by asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) and is secured against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

This project is designed as a learning tool for understanding the integration of frontend and backend technologies in a secure way.

## ✨ Features

* **Multi-Post Feed**: Displays multiple posts from a data source.
* **Asynchronous "Likes"**: Click the like button to update the count instantly without a page reload.
* **CSRF Protection**: All state-changing actions (like liking a post) are protected with a CSRF token.
